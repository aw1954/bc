    <h2>Sunset Park</h2>
    <h3>by Jason Koo</h3>
    <article style="text-align: center; line-height: 1.6;">
        <p>This morning, turned in bed, I thought of lying<br>
            Like that with you in Sunset Park, under the trees,<br>
            Kissing like it was the only thing that mattered,<br>
            Like lips and tongues and saliva could be endless.
        </p>
        <p>
            There was no other happiness but that.<br>
            We’d stop every now and again and look up<br>
            At the long swaying of the branches, the shifting<br>
            Of the leaves, as if the first couple on earth,
        </p>
        <p>
            Amazed at our own luck. I can’t remember<br>
            How we got to the park or what we did after<br>
            We left. I just see us sprawled on our blanket<br>
            Under the trees, high up on the hill, our mouths
        </p>
        <p>
            Full of each other. So many small things took<br>
            Size from that sprawl. I want to be on that hill<br>
            With you again, not worrying about anything,<br>
            Not caring about anything, content to look at you
        </p>
        <p>
            Instead of the city shimmering on the horizon.<br>
            There were so many days I missed between now<br>
            And then, so many moments you looked at me<br>
            Trying to get back to that time, leaning in and closing
        </p>
        <p>
            Your eyes to kiss me…and I kissed you routinely<br>
            And returned to whatever dumb thing I was doing.<br>
            I can see the sadness in your eyes across so many<br>
            Of those days, reflection of the ship departing.
        </p>
        <p>
            But the beginning of our life together: immortality.<br>
            I can see the light lengthening the small floors<br>
            Of our apartment, where you always seemed to be<br>
            Stationed, working on your yoga classes, writing
        </p>
        <p>
            In your little notebooks with your five different<br>
            Colored pens or trying out different poses, sometimes<br>
            Popping up into a handstand, your long hair softly<br>
            Extending down the space from your head to the floor.
        </p>
        <p>
            What was I doing then? Is it possible I was just<br>
            Watching you? Not doing anything, writing, reading?<br>
            Just secretly observing you, marveling over you?<br>
            Those days we’d start to cook and halfway through
        </p>
        <p>
            The warming of something we’d be kissing unable<br>
            To stop, hands all over each other, mouths probing<br>
            And probing, clothes yanked onto the floor, furniture<br>
            Pushed back, soon the smell of something burning.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first time I hurt you, you asked me if I remembered<br>
            Those times, our dirty text messages now some form<br>
            Of purity. I said yes. You said, a little sadly, Those were<br>
            Good times. I thought of Yeats’s phrase a little sadly.
        </p>
        <p>
            Those were times not long before the first pain,<br>
            Only a few months removed, more than a little sadly.<br>
            Hard to believe we could live through bed bugs then,<br>
            Still happy, me sealing up all the things in my bedroom
        </p>
        <p>
            In big blue Ziploc bags and staying at your place,<br>
            Not touching you at the door when I got there but going<br>
            Straight to your shower and taking off my clothes<br>
            And sealing them in their own blue bag, then striding
        </p>
        <p>
            Naked into your living room like some warrior king.<br>
            Those cold days emerging out of your apartment feeling<br>
            Not quite formed, but endless, not knowing anything<br>
            About New York but thinking you were the key, going
        </p>
        <p>
            To the little coffee shop where you introduced me<br>
            To the cappuccino, feeling out of place while we waited<br>
            In line, thinking everyone there had a PhD in coffee.<br>
            How much smaller my world was then, how happy.
        </p>
        <p>
            I liked to say to you as things got worse how happiness<br>
            Didn’t matter, how our lives, our work, were what<br>
            Mattered, if you had these things you believed in you<br>
            Didn’t stop to think about whether you were happy,
        </p>
        <p>
            That was a luxury, an elixir that didn’t last. But now<br>
            I know I didn’t think it mattered because I was happy,<br>
            Despite the sadness, there was always you there, endlessly<br>
            Beside me, I took and took and took from that source
        </p>
        <p>
            Without offering the least endlessness in return.<br>
            I never thought it was possible to lose you, I now see,<br>
            That now see such a stupid phrase I’m doomed to repeat<br>
            Endlessly, floating in the now sea of these seconds
        </p>
        <p>
            Without you, no current toward a future, no horizon.<br>
            If I could just make it last, with a little more effort,<br>
            A little happy, how simple it all seems, touching your face,<br>
            Seeing you again, kissing you kindly, making you happy.
        </p>

        <article style="text-align: center; line-height: 1.6;">
            <p>The Chinese truck driver<br>
                throws the rope<br>
                like a lasso, with a practiced flick,
            </p>
            <p>
                over the load:<br>
                where it hovers an instant,<br>
                then arcs like a willow
            </p>
            <p>
                into the waiting,<br>
                gloved hand<br>
                of his brother.
            </p>
            <p>
                What does it matter<br>
                that, sitting in traffic,<br>
                I glanced out the window
            </p>
            <p>
                and found them that way?<br>
                So lean and sleek-muscled<br>
                in their sweat-stiffened t-shirts:
            </p>
            <p>
                offloading the pallets<br>
                just so they can load up<br>
                again in the morning,
            </p>
            <p>
                and so on,<br>
                and so forth<br>
                forever like that—
            </p>
            <p>
                like Sisyphus<br>
                I might tell them<br>
                if I spoke Mandarin,
            </p>
            <p>
                or had a Marlboro to offer,<br>
                or thought for a minute<br>
                they’d believe it
            </p>
            <p>
                when I say that I know<br>
                how it feels<br>
                to break your own
            </p>
            <p>
                back for a living.<br>
                Then again,<br>
                what’s the difference?
            </p>
            <p>
                When every light<br>
                for a mile turns<br>
                green all at once,
            </p>
            <p>
                no matter how much<br>
                I might like<br>
                to keep watching
            </p>
            <p>
                the older one squint<br>
                and blow smoke<br>
                through his nose?
            </p>
            <p>
                Something like sadness,<br>
                like joy, like a sudden<br>
                love for my life,
            </p>
            <p>
                and for the body<br>
                in which I have lived it,<br>
                overtaking me all at once,
            </p>
            <p>
                as a bus driver honks<br>
                and the setting<br>
                sun glints, so bright
            </p>
            <p>
                off a windshield<br>
                I wince and look back<br>
                and it’s gone. </p>
