        <p>Before Chinese immigrants and Manhattan residents began moving into what is now known as Sunset Park’s Chinatown, the storefronts on Eighth Avenue were mostly vacant. The closing of the Brooklyn waterfront ruined the local economy, displacing Scandinavian immigrants from their main source of employment.

        <p>The Hums were the first family from China to move into the predominantly white working-class area in 1974. In 1987, executive director of the Sunset Park Business Improvement District Renee Giardino said, “Eighth Avenue was almost entirely lined with empty stores.” In 1986, the first Chinese-American grocery store, Winley Supermarket opened on Eighth Avenue and 56th Street. It served as a beacon to other Asian-Americans, encouraging more Asian-Americans to move into the area.

        According to the Brooklyn Chinese-American Association, by 1988 there were approximately 3,000 Asian-Americans and 12 Asian-American-operated businesses in Sunset Park. Manhattan’s Chinatown was becoming more pricey and more crowded, so many residents chose to move to Sunset Park, where the residential and commercial prices were still relatively low in the 1990s.

        Despite the first Chinese immigrants to make their home in Sunset Park being Cantonese speakers, so many Fujianese Mandarin-speaking immigrants have since moved in after 2000 that the area gained the nickname “Little Fuzhou.” In 2013, “Sunset Park was one of the top ten immigrant-populated districts in New York, and one of the top five fastest-growing, with 9 percent growth since 2000.”
